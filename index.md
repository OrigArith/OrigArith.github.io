# About Me

<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Zhibo Yan (严志博)**.<br>

I am master's graduate in Mechanical Engineering from ZJNU, with a solid foundation in computer vision, natural language processing, and deep learning algorithms. I have accumulated extensive experience in various fields, such as Diffusion models and LLM, and have successfully released the first localized version of [SD-WebUI](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1VV4y1u7FF) in China. I possess excellent team leadership and communication skills and have served as the main technical lead in a university-industry collaboration project on industrial defect detection, driving the project to implementation and generating academic results. Meanwhile, I am committed to advancing the application of large models and tracking cutting-edge algorithm applications. Currently, I am an algorithm partner for the [Poppaaws](https://poppaws.ai/) project and the head of the model research group at [MIRACLEPLUS](https://www.miracleplus.com/).<br>

If you are interested in my research or collaborating with me, please contact me via email at [originearith@163.com](mailto:originearith@163.com).
